#### Project Plan: Setting Up Linux Folder Sharing, Automated Video Rendering, and YouTube Video Download Docker Container

## Project 1: Setting Up Linux Folder Sharing

### Objective:

- Share a folder in Linux using both NFS and Samba methods to allow access to other systems on the network.

### Steps:

1. **Install NFS Server and Configure:**
    
    - For Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server`
    - For CentOS/Red Hat: `sudo yum install nfs-utils`
    - Create the shared folder: `sudo mkdir /shared_folder` and set permissions.
    - Edit `/etc/exports` to specify shared directories.
    - Restart the NFS server: `sudo service nfs-kernel-server restart`.

2. **Install Samba and Configure:**
    
    - For Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install samba`
    - For CentOS/Red Hat: `sudo yum install samba`
    - Create the shared folder: `sudo mkdir /shared_folder` and set permissions.
    - Edit Samba configuration file (usually `/etc/samba/smb.conf`) to define the shared folder.
    - Restart the Samba service: `sudo service smbd restart`.

3. **Security and Documentation:**
    
    - Configure firewall rules and permissions as needed.
    - Document the setup, scripts, and procedures for reference and troubleshooting.

## Project 2: Automated Video Rendering System

### Objective:

- Create an automated rendering system for video editing projects placed in a specified folder using Kdenlive.

### Steps:

1. **Choose Server and Install Linux:**
    
    - Select a Linux server with sufficient resources.
    - Install your preferred Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu Server or CentOS).

2. **Connect to the Server:**
    
    - Use SSH to connect to your server: `ssh username@your_server_ip`.

3. **Update and Upgrade:**
    
    - Update package list and upgrade installed packages.

4. **Install Kdenlive and Dependencies:**
    
    - Install Kdenlive and any necessary dependencies.

5. **Set Up a Watched Folder:**
    
    - Choose or create a folder for rendering, e.g., `/home/username/render_queue`.

6. **Create Rendering Script:**
    
    - Develop a script to monitor the folder and trigger rendering using Kdenlive.
    - Customize the script with folder path, rendering options, etc.

7. **Set Up Automatic Execution:**
    
    - Run the script as a background process using nohup or create a systemd service for automatic execution.

8. **Testing and Optimization:**
    
    - Test the system by placing video editing projects into the watched folder.
    - Fine-tune script parameters and server resources for optimal performance.

9. **Security and Backups:**
    
    - Ensure server security, including firewall rules and user permissions.
    - Implement regular backups to protect rendering data.

10. **Documentation:**
    
    - Document the setup, scripts, and procedures for future reference and troubleshooting.

## Project 3: Docker Container for YouTube Video Downloads

### Objective:

- Create a Docker container for downloading YouTube videos using youtube-dl and save them to the shared folder created in Project 1 on the Linux system.

### Steps:

1. **Install Docker:**
    
    - If not already installed, download and install Docker from the official website.

2. **Create Dockerfile:**
    
    - Create a Dockerfile with the specified content.

3. **Build Docker Image:**
    
    - Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile.

4. **Run Docker Container with Volume Mount:**
    
    - Use Docker run command with volume mounting to download videos and save them in the shared folder created in Project 1.

5. **Respect YouTube Terms:**
    
    - Be aware of and adhere to YouTube's terms of service and copyright restrictions when downloading and using content.
